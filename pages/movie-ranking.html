<h1>Fernando's best movie of all time</h1>
<h2>Top 3 Animated Movies</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Maquia: When the Promised Flower Blooms</h3>
<p>
    A very wholesome and also sad fantasy movie about an immortal mother and her mortal adopted son.<br />
    Its a great movie that could probably make any mothers watching it, cry out in tears.<br />
    10/10

<h3>Guillermo Del Toro's Pinocchio (2022)</h3>
<p>
    A wonderful "kids" movie. The movie seems to be an animated movie for kids but adults are welcome to listen to watch this movie.<br />
    That is because this movie has surprisingly dark messages related to war, and death.<br />
    There are also some positive messages about parenting, love and more.
    The story is related to the classic story about Pinocchio.
    This is a stop motion animated movie so be ready to see some stunning visuals.
    10/10 magnifique

<h3>Ratatouille</h3>
<p>
    A movie about a rat with a dream to become a chef...... Sound strange but trust me, its an excellent movie made by the exellent
    movie studio, Pixar. Dont let the cover fool you.<br />
    Ratatouille has shown to have a surprising mature message about criticism and cooking as a whole.<br />
    The movie is humorous for families to watch.<br />
    9.5/5 "Anyone can cook"
